Important!
	I have not made a makefile to automate the process, so if you want to use HunchPy, you need to copy HunchPy.py into the directory where you want to use it, or specifically include it on your path or whatever.

New Features:
    Everything is new!
    Makes a HReq (Hunch Request) class
    Makes all of the api calls methods naturally, returns json as dict
    Has a Recommendation & Recommendation Class class
    Lets you do that nasty javascript chaining if you want to modify attributes
    Has the set_oauth_token(token) method to help with auth tokens


A note on authentication from Harold Cooper, Hunch API Developer:
/start note
Your app should send the user, perhaps from a splash screen or something, to:
http://hunch.com/authorize/v1/?app_id=xxx&next=http://mysite.com/whatever

If they are already logged in and have allowed your app, or once they
log in ... and authorize your app, then they will be redirected to:
http://mysite.com/whatever?auth_token_key=abc&user_id=xxx&next=http://mysite.com/whatever
You can ignore the user_id and next parameters if you want.

Then you make a signed API call to get the actual auth_token:
http://api.hunch.com/api/v1/get-auth-token/?auth_token_key=abc&app_id=xxx&auth_sig=yyy
(where auth_sig is computed for auth_token_key=abc&app_id=xxx using
your app secret)

You will then receive the user's auth_token!
Note that get-auth-token will probably be the only API call you ever
have to sign with your app secret, since most of the other interesting
calls just take an auth_token.
/end note

So you can just run the get_oauth_token() method to get the oauth token (if you've set the properties of the hreq correctly--you need auth_sig, auth_token_key, user_id), and then pass it to set_oauth_token (like so: xxx.set_oauth_token(xxx.get_oauth_token())).  Then you should be good to go with anything that needs an auth_token, at least for request object xxx.

If you find any bugs, either tell me via github (mnn2104) or email me (nakamura.moses at gmail)
